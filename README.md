## Game Summary

*Last Light* is a first-person survival-horror shooter set across a dark outdoor zone and an abandoned warehouse. The player must explore the map, fight enemies, and complete four puzzles to collect the objects needed to escape. Limited visibility and scarce supplies make every encounter dangerous, while fast movement gives the player the tools to survive.

The warehouse contains the final boss and an optional generator. Restoring power makes the battle easier by illuminating the arena, but a player who reaches the warehouse without activating the generator can still attempt the fight in darkness.

## Genres

* First-person shooter
* Survival horror
* Puzzle

## Inspiration

### Left 4 Dead

*Left 4 Dead* is a major influence on the game's survival-horror atmosphere and objective-based exploration. Its dark environments, constant enemy pressure, and emphasis on moving through dangerous spaces inspire the tension we want to create in *Last Light*. Our game will build on these ideas by asking the player to explore hostile areas, locate resources, and search for puzzle components while remaining vulnerable to nearby enemies.

### Lethal Company

*Lethal Company* is the main inspiration for the flashlight system and the tension created by limited visibility. Its handheld flashlight makes light feel like a valuable tool while the player explores dark, unfamiliar environments. *Last Light* will adapt this idea by giving the flashlight limited battery power and placing replacement batteries throughout the map. The player must decide when light is worth consuming, making the flashlight an important resource rather than only a visual effect.

### Quake III Arena

*Quake III Arena* is the main inspiration for the game's fast movement, hip-fire combat, and map design. Its arenas use vertical spaces, open combat areas, and interconnected paths to keep players moving and create multiple ways to approach an encounter. *Last Light* will adapt these ideas to the outdoor zone and warehouse, giving the player room to sprint, slide, and dash while repositioning during combat. Most weapons will be designed for hip-fire instead of aiming down sights, while movement-based crosshair bloom will provide an accuracy tradeoff at high speeds. The screenshot below represents the visual direction for the map's industrial, arena-like spaces.

## Gameplay

* The player begins at a random location in the map's outdoor zone and must find the warehouse.
* Four puzzles and challenges are spread throughout the map (Paper hint will be around the map that guide player to start the puzzle). Completing them rewards the player with the objects to unlock the warehouse door.
    * Puzzle 1: A keypad that requires information from around the map to create the answer key.
    * Puzzle 2: A parkour place that the player must complete without falling.
    * Puzzle 3: Multiple crates around the map and only one of them have the correct object. Everything a wrong crate is broken, a small light point toward the direction of the correct crate.
    * Puzzle 4: A riddle that tells the player to kill a specific number of enemies using a knife only.
* The player can walk, sprint, slide, jump, and dash in midair. Moving creates noise that can alert nearby enemies, and sprinting increases the noise radius.
* Combat uses first-person aiming and shooting. Crosshair bloom reduces accuracy while the player is moving.
* A flashlight helps the player navigate dark areas but has limited battery power. Replacement batteries can be collected throughout the map.
* Health items restore lost health, while perks can provide upgrades such as life steal or increased weapon damage.
* The player can activate a generator to illuminate the warehouse before fighting the final boss. Skipping the generator is possible, but it makes the encounter more difficult.
* After defeating the boss, the player beats the game and unlocks the warehouse as a permanent safe point.
* The game uses keyboard-and-mouse controls: WASD movement and mouse aiming, with additional inputs for jumping, sprinting, sliding, dashing, interacting, and toggling the flashlight.
* The interface will display a crosshair along with the player's health and remaining flashlight battery.

Graphics:
* First-person perspective with low-poly visuals inspired by classic shooters.
* A dark, low-visibility environment in which the flashlight and weapon fire provide important sources of light.
* Strong lighting contrast between the unpowered warehouse and the illuminated arena after the generator is activated.

## Development Plan

### Project Checkpoint 1-2: Basic Mechanics and Scripting (Ch. 5-9)

* Implement the core movement system, excluding animation:
  * Walking
  * Sprinting
  * Jumping and midair dashing
  * Sliding
* Create a basic blockout of the outdoor zone and warehouse to test scale, navigation, and movement.
* Implement the flashlight system:
  * Toggleable light
  * Limited battery charge
  * Battery pickups
